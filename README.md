# ðŸŽ¸ Band Explorer â€“ React SPA Demo

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React. It displays a dynamic list of music bands based on mock data and allows users to explore information using a search bar and genre filters.

## API

### **Mock API Server (Express)**
- A separate mini-project in the `api/` folder provides a mock API using Express.
- The server serves JSON files from the `api/data/` directory at the endpoint:

  ```
  http://localhost:3001/mocks/:file
  ```
  For example, `/mocks/bands` returns the list of bands, and `/mocks/001` returns details for band with ID `001`.

- If a requested JSON file does not exist, the server responds with a default JSON object:
  ```json
  {
    "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
  }
  ```

- CORS is enabled for local development (e.g., Vite at `http://localhost:5173`).

### **Mock Data**
- The `api/data/` folder contains:
  - `bands.json`: List of all bands.
  - Individual band files (e.g., `001.json`, `005.json`) with details for each band.
